# VodRecovery
* Created By: ItIckeYd
* Initial Release: May 3rd, 2022
* The script is used to retrieve sub-only and deleted videos from twitch.
* Credits to daylamtayari - TwitchRecover repository helped with the logic to recover twitch videos.

# Script Requirements
* MUST have python installed.
* MUST have additional packages installed (ie.. Requests)

# Script Notes
* The script CANNOT recover every single vod. The script can only recover vods that still exist on the twitch vod domains.
* Ensure to enter the seconds value as 00 when running the script as the script brute forces the seconds value automatically.

# Analytical Sites
* The following sites can be used to provide the information that the script requires:
1. TwitchTracker.com
2. Sullygnome.com
3. Streamscharts.com

# Optional IDE
* Python has a few code editors that can be used which include the following:
1. PyCharm
2. Visual Studio Code

# Additional Notes
* If creating an issue for a problem that your experiencing please provide atleast 1 example.
* If you are not getting results back from the script. Please try vods from other streamers, if the other streamers vods give you results then the original vods you were trying probably just don't exist.
